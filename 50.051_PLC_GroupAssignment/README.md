## how to run
```
make
```
### part 1:
```
./part1 your_input.csv output_file_name.json
```
you can try the sample input csv
```
./part1 part1_sample_input.csv output.json
```
you will see `output.json` in the folder matching `part1_sample_result.json`.
### part 2:
```
./part2
```
You will be prompted to input the file name (`student` here, as an example).
Then it will read `student.json` and generate `student.cpp` and `student.h` accordingly.

### part 3:
```
./part3
```
Similarly, input the same as part 2.
After reading `student.txt`, methods will be added into `student.cpp` and `student.h`. 

### clean:
```
make clean
```
